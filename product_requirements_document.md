# Product Requirements Document: GCP Resource Extractor

## Document Information
- **Product Name**: GCP Resource Extractor
- **Document Version**: 1.0
- **Last Updated**: May 6, 2025
- **Status**: Draft

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The GCP Resource Extractor is designed to automatically discover and extract all resources from a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) organization and export them as YAML files. This enables infrastructure-as-code practices, auditing, migration planning, and disaster recovery preparation.

### 1.2 Product Overview
The GCP Resource Extractor is a Python-based command-line tool that authenticates with GCP, traverses an organization's resource hierarchy, discovers all resources across projects and services, and exports their configurations as structured YAML files.

### 1.3 Scope
The tool will support extraction of resources from all major GCP services including but not limited to Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Cloud SQL, Kubernetes Engine, IAM, VPC, and Cloud Functions.

## 2. Target Users and Use Cases

### 2.1 Target Users
- Cloud Administrators
- DevOps Engineers
- Security Auditors
- Infrastructure Engineers
- Site Reliability Engineers

### 2.2 Use Cases
1. **Infrastructure Documentation**: Generate comprehensive documentation of all cloud resources
2. **Disaster Recovery Planning**: Create backup configurations for disaster recovery scenarios
3. **Migration Planning**: Export configurations for migrating between environments or regions
4. **Compliance Auditing**: Generate inventory of resources for compliance documentation
5. **Configuration Analysis**: Allow for offline analysis of cloud architecture and configurations

## 3. Functional Requirements

- Support for all major GCP service resources
- Include resource relationships and dependencies

### 3.3 Data Extraction
- Extract resource configurations including metadata and properties
- Support for paginated API responses
- Rate limiting and throttling to respect API quotas
- Parallel processing for optimized extraction

### 3.4 Data Export
- Export resources as YAML files
- Maintain hierarchy in directory structure
- Support for file naming conventions

- Configuration file support
- Resource filtering capabilities (by service, type, project, etc.)
- Exclusion patterns for specific resources

### 3.6 Error Handling
- Graceful error recovery
- Detailed logging of errors and warnings
- Resume capability for interrupted operations

## 4. Non-functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance
- Complete extraction of an average-sized organization (50-100 projects) within 30 minutes
- Optimized API calls to minimize extraction time
- Low CPU and memory footprint

### 4.2 Scalability
- Support for organizations with up to 1000 projects
- Support for projects with thousands of resources
- Efficient handling of large-scale extractions

### 4.3 Reliability
- 99% success rate for resource extraction
- Retry mechanism for transient failures
- Validation of exported YAML for consistency

### 4.4 Security
- No storage of credentials
- Secure handling of API tokens and keys
- Read-only operations on GCP resources
- No exposure of sensitive data in logs or output

### 4.5 Usability
- Clear documentation and usage examples
- Intuitive command-line interface
- Meaningful error messages
- Progress reporting during operation

### 4.6 Compatibility
- Support for Python 3.8+
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Support for containerized execution (Docker)

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1 Dependencies
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Cloud SDK Python libraries
- YAML parsing and generation libraries
- Robust logging framework

### 5.2 API Integration
- Use of Google Cloud API v1 or newer
- Support for API versioning changes
- Handling of API deprecations

### 5.3 Output Format
- Structured YAML format with consistent schema
- Resource type identification in YAML
- Reference linking between related resources
- Human-readable formatting

## 6. Constraints

### 6.1 API Limitations
- Respect GCP API rate limits
- Handle service-specific quotas and limitations

### 6.2 Permission Constraints
- Operation within least-privilege security model
- Documentation of minimum required permissions

## 7. Milestones and Priorities

### 7.1 Priority Features (Must Have)
1. Authentication and basic resource extraction
2. Support for core services (Compute, Storage, Networking)
3. YAML export functionality
4. Command-line interface
5. Basic error handling

### 7.2 Secondary Features (Should Have)
1. Support for additional GCP services
2. Filtering capabilities
3. Dependency mapping between resources
4. Resume capability for interrupted extractions

### 7.3 Tertiary Features (Nice to Have)
1. Web interface for configuration and monitoring
2. Resource visualization
3. Differential exports (changes only)
4. Scheduled extraction jobs

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

1. Successfully authenticate to a GCP organization
2. Discover and extract resources from all major GCP services
3. Export valid, well-formatted YAML files representing all resources
4. Execute with appropriate error handling and logging
5. Complete extraction within performance requirements
6. Documentation for installation and usage is complete

## 9. Future Considerations

1. Import functionality to create resources from YAML
2. Integration with CI/CD pipelines
3. Support for multi-cloud environments
4. Comparison tools for different extracted states
5. Resource cost analysis based on extracted data
